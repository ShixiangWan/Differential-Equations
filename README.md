# Differential-Equations
Every year I teach a course in Differential Equations and Linear Algebra. This repository holds iPython notebooks that have been used for in-class demonstrations and visualizations. Note that there are some errors that appear in rendering the LaTeX in the Jupyter notebook on Github. Download the files and they should render error-free.
